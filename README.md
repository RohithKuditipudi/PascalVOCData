# PascalVOCData
AnnotateVOC2012.R is a script that can be used to obtain the ground truth bounding boxes of the images in the PASCAL VOC dataset (from 2007-2012), given a directory of the XML annotation files (provided with the dataset itself) of each image. Specifically, the script will parse each XML file, convert it into an R data table in which each row will contain the info (x1,x2,y1,y2,object) needed to recover one of the ground truth bounding boxes in the image, and then save this data table as a .txt file in CSV format (the name of the saved file will be "<image name>.txt") in a separate directory specified by the user.

To use the script, the user should first specify the directory in which the XML annotation files currently are and then specify the directory to which they wish to save the .txt files produced by the script.
